PASS – Offline Password Manager (Web App)
About PASS
PASS is a privacy-focused, offline-first password manager web app designed to help you securely store and manage your credentials without relying on cloud servers, accounts, or third-party tracking.
Unlike traditional credentials managers, PASS works entirely in your browser and keeps your data under your full control.
There is no login, no registration, no cloud sync, and no data collection.
How PASS Works
PASS stores all your credentials using your browser’s local storage.
This means:
Your data stays on your device
Nothing is uploaded automatically
No external database is involved
You decide when data is exported or removed
Once the app is loaded, it can work offline.
